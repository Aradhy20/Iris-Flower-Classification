# Iris-Flower-Classification
🌸 Iris Flower Classification | Machine Learning Project
This repository contains a simple yet powerful machine learning project to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their morphological features — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

✅ Key Highlights:
📊 Dataset: 

🧠 Model Used: Logistic Regression / K-Nearest Neighbors / Decision Tree / (you can mention the actual model you used)

🧪 Evaluation: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

📈 Tools: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

📚 Concepts Covered:

Data preprocessing & visualization

Model training & testing

Performance evaluation

Basic classification in ML

🔍 Objective:
To build a supervised learning model that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on input features. This project demonstrates the foundational steps of a machine learning workflow including EDA, model training, and evaluation.
